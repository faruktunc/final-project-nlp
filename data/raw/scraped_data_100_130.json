The Owner has made several improvements since purchasing; some of the work that has been done is the careful execution of clearing of scrub and brush from the southern half of the acreage while leaving clusters of trees for beauty and privacy while the northern half has received nearly a hundred loads of fill dirt in to prepare for a pad for building.  There was additional work done with the removal of several dead trees to beautify and a privatize the northern half as well.  The current pond, which could be enlarged if desired, is at the front north side of the entry to the driveway and has several types of trees that surround the front part of the property again for beauty as well as privacy.  The East-West Waterway carries overflow from the many streams that feed from the Manatee and Braden Rivers but rarely is there more than a foot of water in the basin.  The rainy season brings the bulk of the waterflow but it has never breached it's boundary.  There is a second waterline but it is a moist usually muddy brook that runs east west for about 300 ft then turns south and feeds directly into the main Waterway.  The property has a stockade fence entry off CR675 with an concrete apron into the lot. This would be an exceptional location for a multi-generational family compound as you could build on both sides of the waterway.   So many options..."
