Three tennis courts at international standards have been added to the site by the municipality, and a modern living space has been created by adding social facilities and new roads around it.

The minibus departs in front of the market in the site, it provides great convenience in terms of transportation.

Free well water is available on site, so you can meet your water needs such as garden irrigation at no additional cost. There are plum, lemon, pomegranate and olive trees in our garden, offering a pleasant life intertwined with nature. Since our house is located in a corner location, you will not have parking problems with your guests; In addition to your own garage, 2-3 cars can be conveniently parked on the side of the house.
