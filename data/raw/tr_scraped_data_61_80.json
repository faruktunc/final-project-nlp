      "description": "IZA INVESTMENT REAL ESTATE SOLE AUTHORIZED Technical Information Land Area: 11.864, 02 m (large land in a single title deed) Zoning Status: Tourism Facility Area (Tourism zoned land). It has an official zoning status suitable for accommodation purposes. Precedent (KAKS): 0.20 (20 percent construction rate). Total Construction Right: Approximately 2.370 m closed construction area. Maximum Building Height: 6.50 m (two-storey building permit). Number of Permitted Floors: 2 floors (ground + 1 normal floor). Infrastructure Status: The land has a frontage to the cadastral road. Road, electricity and water infrastructures in the region are already in place, and the necessary connections can be easily provided during the construction phase. Investment Advantages This tourism-zoned land in Faralya stands out not only as a good project development but also as a smart investment with high earning potential. Rapidly Growing Tourism Potential: Mula province is one of the most tourist-attracting regions in Turkey and hosts millions of domestic/foreign tourists every year. Fethiye Faralya region has become a destination that has increased in popularity, especially in recent years. Holidaymakers looking for natural beauty prefer boutique hotel and villa accommodation. The facility to be built on this land will make an advantageous start in terms of occupancy by responding to the increasing demand for accommodation in the region. High demand offers the opportunity to maximize operating revenues and therefore return on investment. Real Estate Value Increase: Real estate prices in Turkey's coastal regions have increased significantly recently. Especially in Mula and its surroundings, there has been an increase in demand that has accelerated with the pandemic period, and those who have invested in regions such as Fethiye have achieved significant gains in property values. The supply of zoned land in Faralya is extremely limited; It is not easy to find a land with a sea view on this scale. When the developing zoning infrastructure of the region is completed, the land value and the market value of the project to be built will increase exponentially. The investment to be made today has a strong capital gain potential in the medium and long term. High Rental Income and Fast Return: The nightly rental prices of luxury accommodation units are quite high in the Fethiye region. Villas with a similar concept in Faralya can also be rented on a nightly or weekly basis to bring high income. If a facility of 10 villas is operated with average occupancy in the summer season and off-season, the annual gross rental income will be quite high. Such a short ROI time in the tourism sector makes the project extremely attractive from a financial point of view. Examples of Success in Similar Projects: Similar villa hotel concept projects implemented in Fethiye and its surroundings have provided high profits to their investors. Boutique hotels and luxury villa rental businesses in the region operate with seasonal occupancy rates of up to 80-90% and increase their brand value with positive customer comments. For example, some outstanding facilities serving in Faralya and Kabak Bay are at the top of international tourism platforms thanks to the unique experience they offer and are growing steadily every year. The project to be developed on this land has the potential to achieve a similar success with the right planning and operation strategy. Interested Investors This unique investment opportunity is ideal for both those who want to develop an outstanding tourism project by taking advantage of the natural beauty of the region and professional investors aiming for high returns. This 11, 864 m tourism-zoned land in Faralya has a rare earning potential when combined with the right vision.
