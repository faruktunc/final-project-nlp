This very unique HALF ACRE property contains 3 completely renovated units that have been operating as a successful short term rental (AirBnb) for the last four years. Prime location only a mere 2.5 miles from SIESTA KEY, but in Flood Zone X requiring no flood insurance. The best of both worlds!  Single family house in the front - with 2 bed/2 bathrooms, open floor plan, vaulted ceilings, inside laundry, 2 screened porches, and a private fenced yard and grill  - renovated in 2018 in cottage style - is included on the National Historic Register making it part of a unique piece of Sarasota history. There is a duplex located just beyond the single family and houses 2 additional fully renovated cottage-style units. Cozy 1 bedroom/1 bath units share a laundry around back. Each duplex unit has a private backyard, grill, picnic table and chairs. All 3 units are metered separately for ultimate flexibility, and all 3 units have newer impact windows. All landscaped areas have new irrigation system in place. There is a ZEN garden between the units where all guests can enjoy the water sounds from the bird fountain. All 3 units have a new metal roof installed in 2017-18 giving you peace of mind for the next 30 years. At the back of the property, there is a LARGE GARAGE (30x24) and CARPORT, lots of potential additional parking, and a cute little \"She Shed\" that is completely finished inside with AC. It is currently being used by Prop Mgmt for light storage but could be set up as a small reading room/library for community use. The garage could be rented separately as well, or converted to community use (i.e. theater room, pool table, exercise room, shower and bathroom as plumbing and water are already nearby). There are also RV hookups already in place, so we are including the 2018 Heartland Mallard M33 RV already set up and ready to go for wherever your imagination takes you. You could continue to run this as an AIRBnB - we will help with a smooth transition. Property manager already in place. Many ways to increase income at this property - including creating amenities at the back of the property with existing structures to fulfill the new trend of \"Destination\" properties on AIRBnB. Or you could convert the 3 units to annual rentals, and rent out the facilities at the back of the property separately. Or you could live in one of the units, and rent out the rest of them either short term or long term, and/or use the garage for yourself for workshop, inventory storage, storing large construction vehicles, etc.  The possibilities are endless - because the LOCATION is PRIME. Detweilers supermarket, Publix, Gulf Gate shopping, the post office, and a plethora of restaurants and shops are located within 1-2 miles. Very quiet property. Buyer agent to verify all information. These units come Turn Key Furnished."

With over 2000 heated square feet, this move-in ready home has ample space for living and entertaining. Walking up the front concrete sidewalk, you'll be welcomed by a front porch that is made for sipping your morning coffee at sunrise. Entering the home, you'll find an unexpectedly open floorplan. The large living room with hardwood floors has sight lines all the way out into the backyard, allowing lots of natural light to cascade into the home. The kitchen is a galley style that has an oversized breakfast bar that adjoins the dining area. The dining area has sliding glass doors with screens that lead to the deck, which is ideal for grilling, smoking meat, or cooking up some fried rice on your griddle.

On the other end of the house and up a few stairs is a bonus space with a full bathroom and closet that is now being used as a bedroom but would also make a fabulous library, crafting room, art studio, sewing room, music studio, hobby room, playroom, etc. Down a few stairs is a rec room that would be ideal as a gaming room with a kitchenette and a half bathroom. I can see this being the fun/casual space everyone will want to hang out in!Kick the summer off right with a dip in the pool or sunning on a lounge chair with no neighbors as far as the eye can see. The home sits back off of the road for a great buffer between you and the rest of the world. The coastal colored board and batten siding gives an unexpected pop that will no doubt make you want to embrace those summer vibes.The wired gazebo in the front yard  would be so whimsical with some string lights during the warm months and Christmas lights during the cold months. There is also a detached garage that would make a great workshop, storage space for your motorcycle, ATV, or UTV. The property sits on 2 parcels and has a second potential entrance point, septic, and hookup to the current well if you ever wanted to sell one off or have a loved one build a home beside you. There is also a large carport adjoining the rec room which also offers great cover for outside entertaining. There is also plenty of parking space for your boat and camper or RV. The storm shelter will provide peace of mind during the Tennessee storms. The home has a metal roof, newer vinyl windows, and a brand new dishwasher. The seller is also leaving the range, microwave, refrigerator, washer, dryer, downstairs TV, window treatments, and book cases to set you up for success."
