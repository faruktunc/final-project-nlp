Public transport runs along the sea through different districts. There are multiple car rental services available as well as food and water delivery and many other amenities. At the same time we can say that Kestel is a new district, where high-rise developments are prohibited, so Kestel is a homely and cozy district. From one side Kestel borders Mahmutlar, the most built-up district, from the other side Tosmur. Kestel is certainly inferior to its neighbors in terms of infrastructure, but it suits perfectly for a quiet life. It should be noted that mainly Europeans settle in this district. If you want to live quietly, but in a prestigious district with essential infrastructure and good beaches, then you should take a closer look at real estate in Kestel. Apartments in new developments and finished buildings are remarkable for their nice views and proximity to the beach."
