The cabinets have a whimsical seaside feel with a blue wash, rustic exposed hinges and pulls while the dark stone floors inset with real copper pennies and the distressed beachwood-looking kitchen floors hint at vintage luxury.  The upgraded granite plays on the color while the hand-hammered copper sink and dishwasher panel exude a seaside, almost nautical-like quality.  The vaulted ceilings and skylights bring the outside in, while the lighting complements and accentuates all these elements.  You can almost taste the salt in the air.  Contrasting the casual beach-like feel inside, the near downtown and pedestrian location offers an urban feel replete with the sounds of the city.  It's a combination that almost sounds like the ocean in the distance.  The floorplan is extremely versatile, offering up to 3 bedrooms or 2 and a den and 2 full baths.  But that's not all!  The primary with its separate entrance affords the new owner the opportunity to create a separate apartment for a multi-generational solution or extra income as a rental.  The covered and enclosed patio adds additional usable space and leads to the sizable back yard down to the creek. With a large driveway and covered two-car carport, this home awaits someone special who wants a single-family residence instead of a condo or townhome.  No shared walls and no HOA either, make this Conejo Valley Living at its easiest."

With three bedrooms, two full baths, and solid bones, it offers the kind of space and structure that's getting harder to find these days. It's been a rental property for the last several years, and, while it's completely livable as-is, it's ready for someone with vision to come in and make it shine again.No known issues with the foundation, wiring, or water intrusion or anything serious like that—just the kind of cosmetic overhaul you'd expect to be needed in a home that hasn't seen much updating in a while. The layout has potential, the yard is a standout, and the price reflects the work that still needs to be done.Location-wise, you're just minutes from everyday essentials: Food City and Kroger are both within a 10-minute drive, making grocery runs quick and convenient. UT Medical Center is also about a 20 minute drive. And, geographically, this home is perfectly positioned between Knoxville and the Smokies. Downtown Knoxville is about 20 minutes away, offering a vibrant mix of dining, shopping, and cultural attractions. Head the other direction, and you're roughly 30 minutes from Pigeon Forge, Gatlinburg, and the entrance to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park—ideal for weekend getaways, hiking excursions or entertaining out-of-town guests.If you've been looking for a project with great potential in a great location or if you're in the market for something affordable with upside to make your own, this one might be worth a closer look.

      "description": "Located in the sought-after community of Pacific Ranch. Driving through the guard-gated entrance, you feel like you're on vacation. With lush, landscaped grounds, this neighborhood has it all. This Barcelona model is a Tri-Level, just a hair under 2000 square feet, and has been remodeled to perfection. As you enter through the sun-filled front patio, you know you'll love this home immediately. The entrance opens into an oversized living room where you can cozy up with a good book before the fireplace. The remodeled gourmet kitchen features a breakfast bar, all matching stainless-steel appliances, beautiful granite counters, oversized white cabinetry with all the features you are looking for, such as pull-out shelving, a corner lazy-susan, and glass accents, not to mention the custom backsplash, that runs up to hidden lights under the cabinets. The kitchen faucet is touchless, the 5-burner gas stove is perfect for cooking family meals and entertaining larger groups, and features another patio directly off the kitchen. Three bedrooms are located upstairs, and the primary bedroom and bath are to die for. And that's not all.... There is also an oversized extra room on the bottom level that can be used as a bedroom, office, or workout room, and includes its own en suite bathroom with a walk-in shower. The convenient inside laundry room and direct garage access make it so easy to live here. Enjoy strolling through the lighted park-like grounds, three pools, spa, BBQ, & clubhouses for even more entertainment. Do you love the Beach Life? Pacific Ranch has excellent restaurants and shops approximately 1.5 miles from the ocean. HERE ARE THE REASONS I paid over $225,000 more for this unit. I was in escrow across the driveway for a similar unit, a 3-bedroom 3.5 bath that needed updates and lacked the sunshine I love/crave on my THREE patios/balcony. In the morning, I wake to my 7 to 8 AM BACK patio coffee, from 11 to 3 pm, I enjoy my afternoon kickbacks on the FRONT patio. My primary suite, UPSTAIRS, has a balcony that overlooks green foliage, and we appreciate the comfortable ocean breezes from the southwest that run through the three bedrooms upstairs. The quiet of this backside location is ideal. The updated primary ensuite bathroom feels like it is right out of a luxurious hotel, & the upgrades in the kitchen sealed the deal for me. Please make an appointment, as there will be no open public houses.PICTURES-2 YEARS OLD-FURNITURE INSIDE IS SET UP DIFFERENTLY"
